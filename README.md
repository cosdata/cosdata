## Getting Started

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Cosdata on Linux systems.

### Prerequisites

Before installing Cosdata, ensure you have the following:

- Git
- Rust (version 1.81.0 or higher)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager, toolchain version 1.81.0 or higher)
- A C++ compiler (GCC 4.8+ or Clang 3.4+)

### Installation Steps

#### Building Cosdata as a developer

Clone the Cosdata repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/cosdata/cosdata.git
cd cosdata
```

Build the project:

```
cargo build --release
```

### Running Cosdata

You can build Cosdata as a user and simply run the Cosdata server, follow the following steps. Easily installable version of Cosdata will be available soon.

Clone the Cosdata repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/cosdata/cosdata.git
cd cosdata
```

Install the binaries:

```
# Compiles the latest code and installs the binary.
cargo install --path .
```

And run the binary:
```
cosdata --admin-key <your admin key>
```

This should start the server. You should see log lines similar to the following:

```
[2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  cosdata::web_server] starting HTTP server at http://127.0.0.1:8443
[2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  actix_server::builder] starting 20 workers
[2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  actix_server::server] Actix runtime found; starting in Actix runtime
[2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  actix_server::server] starting service: "actix-web-service-127.0.0.1:8443", workers: 20, listening on: 127.0.0.1:8443
[2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  cosdata::grpc::server] gRPC server listening on [::1]:50051
```

### Testing Cosdata Server

#### Testing Cosdata Server with `test.py`

To quickly get started with Cosdata, you can run the `test.py` file available in the top level directory. The `test.py` script -

1. Creates a test collection and a Dense HNSW Index.
2. In a transaction, submits batches of Random vectors to be stored on the server.
3. Uses about 10% of the vectors from the above set as query vectors by adding small perturbations.
4. Issues query to the server to perform the search against the query vectors and performs a brute force search locally using `cosine` distance.
5. Compares the results

In order to run the `test.py` file a few dependencies need to be added. The description here uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for downloading and setting up required dependencies. Perform following steps.

```
# Run uv sync to setup the Python virtual Env and download and install dependencies using `pyproject.toml` file.
uv sync

# Run the test.py file
uv run test.py
```

The script will then perform the steps described above and display the summary of execution


#### Testing Cosdata Server with `test-dataset.py`

You can test Cosdata server using real world datasets. This is performed using `test-dataset.py`.  (TODO: Add details for this).


### Running Cosdata in in HTTPS mode

It's recommended to run Cosdata server in HTTPS mode i.e. with TLS
support. However, during development it might be easier to get it
running without TLS. To do so, set `server.mode=http` in the
[config.toml](config.toml) file.

Alternately, you may use self-signed certificates for testing the
APIs. The paths to the certificate and private key files are
configured in the [config.toml](config.toml) file.

This sections mentions how you can generate and setup the certificates.

#### Generate Certificates

Run the following commands in sequence to get the private key and certificate

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private_key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out self_signed_certificate.crt

# Convert the private key to PKCS#8 format
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in private_key.pem -out private_key_pkcs8.pem -nocrypt
```

#### Setup Certificates

Set the `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variable to the folder where you're gonna store the certificates:

```bash
export SSL_CERT_DIR="/etc/ssl"
```

Move certificates to appropriate folders and set permissions:

```bash
# Create directories if don't exist
sudo mkdir -p $SSL_CERT_DIR/{certs,private}

# Move certificates
sudo mv self_signed_certificate.crt $SSL_CERT_DIR/certs/cosdata-ssl.crt
sudo mv private_key_pkcs8.pem $SSL_CERT_DIR/private/cosdata-ssl.key

# Create 'ssl-cert' group (if if doesn't exist already)
sudo groupadd ssl-cert

# Change private key file permissions
sudo chgrp ssl-cert $SSL_CERT_DIR/private/cosdata-ssl.key
sudo chmod 640 $SSL_CERT_DIR/private/cosdata-ssl.key
sudo usermod -aG ssl-cert $USER

# Change private key folder permissions
sudo chmod 750 $SSL_CERT_DIR/private
sudo chgrp ssl-cert $SSL_CERT_DIR/private

# Add yourself to ssl-cert group (you may need to re-login after this)
newgrp ssl-cert
```
