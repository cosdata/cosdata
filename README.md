### Prerequisites

- **Git** (v2.0+)  
- **Rust** (v1.81.0+) & **Cargo**  
- **C++ compiler**  
  - GCC ‚â•¬†4.8 **or** Clang ‚â•¬†3.4 

<br>

> **Tip:** On Ubuntu/Debian you can install everything with:  
> ```bash
> sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git build-essential curl \
>    clang lld rustc cargo
> ```

<br>

### üöÄ Build & Run

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cosdata/cosdata.git
   cd cosdata
   ```

2. **Compile in release mode**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   ./target/release/cosdata --admin-key YOUR_ADMIN_KEY
   ```

> You should see logs like:
> 
> ```text
> [[2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  cosdata::web_server] starting HTTP server at http://127.0.0.1:8443
> [2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  actix_server::builder] starting 20 workers
> [2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  actix_server::server] Actix runtime found; starting in Actix runtime
> [2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  actix_server::server] starting service: "actix-web-service-127.0.0.1:8443"
> [2025-02-21T02:30:29Z INFO  cosdata::grpc::server] gRPC server listening on [::1]:50051
> ```

<br>

## 3. Testing Your Installation

### üß™ Quick Validation Cosdata Server with `test.py`

Cosdata includes a `test.py` script in the top level directory, to validate your server setup. This script will:

1. **Create** a test collection and a Dense HNSW index.  
2. **Insert** batches of random vectors in a single transaction.  
3. **Generate** query vectors by perturbing ~10% of the inserted vectors.  
4. **Search** the server for nearest neighbors using its HNSW index.  
5. **Verify** results by comparing against a local brute‚Äëforce cosine distance search.


### üîß Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**  
- The [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) CLI for virtual‚Äëenv & dependency management  
- A running Cosdata server at `http://127.0.0.1:8443`



### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Execution

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```


This will:

-   Create a Python virtual environment
-   Install packages listed in `pyproject.toml`
    

2.  **Run the test script**
    ```bash
    uv run test.py
    ```
    
3.  **Review the output**  
    The script prints a summary, including:
    
    -   Number of vectors inserted
    -   Queries executed
    -   Pass/fail status for each comparison
        

> **Tip:** If any test fails, check your server logs under `~/.cosdata/logs/` or review console output for errors.


<br>

### üîç Testing with Real‚ÄëWorld Datasets (`test-dataset.py`)

Use the `test-dataset.py` script to benchmark Cosdata against real‚Äëworld datasets:

1.  **Download** or mount the dataset (e.g., SIFT, GloVe embeddings).
    
2.  **Index** the dataset using your chosen index type (HNSW, IVF, etc.).
    
3.  **Query** sample vectors and record accuracy & latency metrics.
    
4.  **Compare** Cosdata‚Äôs performance against baseline implementations.
    

> **TODO:** Add download links, configuration flags, and step‚Äëby‚Äëstep instructions for each dataset.


<br>

## 4. HTTPS Configuration (TLS)

By default, Cosdata runs over HTTP, but we **strongly recommend** enabling HTTPS in production.



### 1. Development Mode (HTTP)

If you just want to spin up the server quickly without TLS, edit your `config.toml`:

```toml
[server]
mode = "http"
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** HTTP mode is **not** secure‚Äîonly use this for local development or testing.


### 2. Enabling TLS (HTTPS)

To run Cosdata over HTTPS, you need:

1.  **TLS certificates** (self‚Äësigned OK for testing)
    
2.  A valid `config.toml` pointing at your certs
    
3.  Proper file permissions


#### a. Generate a Self‚ÄëSigned Certificate

1. Create a new RSA key and self‚Äësigned cert (valid 1 year)

   ```bash
   openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private_key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out self_signed_certificate.crt
   ```

2. Convert the private key to PKCS#8 format

   ```bash
   openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in private_key.pem -out private_key_pkcs8.pem -nocrypt
   ```


#### b. Store & Secure Your Certificates

1. Set your cert directory (choose a secure path)

   ```bash
   export SSL_CERT_DIR="/etc/ssl"
   ```

2. Create subdirectories

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p $SSL_CERT_DIR/{certs,private}
   ```


3. Move certs into place

   ```bash
   sudo mv self_signed_certificate.crt   $SSL_CERT_DIR/certs/cosdata.crt
   sudo mv private_key_pkcs8.pem         $SSL_CERT_DIR/private/cosdata.key
   ```


4. Secure the private key

   ```bash
   sudo groupadd ssl-cert            || true
   sudo chgrp ssl-cert $SSL_CERT_DIR/private/cosdata.key
   sudo chmod 640  $SSL_CERT_DIR/private/cosdata.key
   sudo chmod 750  $SSL_CERT_DIR/private
   sudo usermod -aG ssl-cert $USER   # you may need to log out/in or run `newgrp ssl-cert`
   ```



#### c. Configure Cosdata to Use TLS

In your `config.toml`, update the `[server]` section:

   ```toml
   [server]
   mode     = "https"
   tls_cert = "/etc/ssl/certs/cosdata.crt"
   tls_key  = "/etc/ssl/private/cosdata.key"
   ```


#### d. Restart Cosdata

If running directly:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/cosdata --admin-key YOUR_ADMIN_KEY
   ```

If using Docker, mount your cert directory:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm \
     -v "/etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs:ro" \
     -v "/etc/ssl/private:/etc/ssl/private:ro" \
     cosdatateam/cosdata:latest \
     cosdata --admin-key YOUR_ADMIN_KEY
   ```


### üîé Verify HTTPS

Open your browser or run:

```bash
curl -kv https://localhost:8443/health
```

You should see a successful TLS handshake and a healthy status response.

# Initialize the Cosdata client
client = Client(
    host="https://127.0.0.1:8443",
    admin_key="YOUR_ADMIN_KEY",
)

# Create a new collection (vector dimension = 768)
