* Vector store persistence

** Problem
   - Currently, the instances of struct ~VectorStore~ are only held in
     memory, as part of the ~vector_store_map~ field of ~AppEnv~.
   - This means if the process is restarted, previously created vector
     stores (collections) will be lost

** Requirements
   1. At startup we need to get a list of all collection names in the
      db. This operation should be straightforward
   2. Some fields can be mutable e.g. ~max_cache_level~, ~levels_prob~
      etc. It should be easy and efficient to modify these
      individually.
   3. Check if a collection exists

** Where to store the data
   As we're already using lmdb for storing metadata, vector store data
   can also be stored in lmdb. More about how it will be stored is
   covered in a later section.

** Data to be persisted
   The ~VectorStore~ struct is defined as follows,
   #+begin_src rust
     #[derive(Clone)]
     pub struct VectorStore {
         pub exec_queue_nodes: ExecQueueUpdate,
         pub max_cache_level: u8,
         pub database_name: String,
         pub root_vec: LazyItemRef<MergedNode>,
         pub levels_prob: Arc<Vec<(f64, i32)>>,
         pub quant_dim: usize,
         pub prop_file: Arc<File>,
         pub lmdb: MetaDb,
         pub current_version: ArcShift<Hash>,
         pub current_open_transaction: ArcShift<Option<Hash>>,
         pub quantization_metric: Arc<QuantizationMetric>,
         pub distance_metric: Arc<DistanceMetric>,
         pub storage_type: StorageType,
         pub vcs: Arc<VersionControl>,
     }
   #+end_src
   Note that,
   - Not all fields of the struct need to be persisted to disk
   - Some additional fields, not present in the struct are also need
     to be persisted.

   Following is a list of all the fields that need to be stored in the db

*** max_cache_level
    - Meaning: Total HNSW levels
    - Type: u8
    - Example: 5
    - Default: 5
    - Part of the VectorStore struct
    - Suggestion: The name ~max_cache_level~ is related to legacy
      code. It can be names as ~max_levels~ in the db to avoid
      confusion.

*** levels_prob
    - Type: ~Vec<(f64, i32)>~
    - Part of the VectorStore struct
    - Example
      #+begin_src rust
        [(0.99999, 5), (0.9999, 4), (0.999, 3), (0.99, 2), (0.9, 1), (0.0, 0)]
      #+end_src
    - Suggestion: Even if we store just the probabilities in order, the
      above format can be easily obtained.

*** quant_dim
    - Type: usize
    - Default: ~size as usize / 32~
    - Part of the VectorStore struct

*** current version
    - Type: Hash (versioning u32 SipHash)
    - Part of the VectorStore struct

*** quantization_metric
    - Type: String
    - Default: scalar
    - Possible values
      + Scalar
      + Product with product quantization data
        + no. of centroids: u16
        + centroid values: u16
    - Part of the VectorStore struct

*** distance_metric
    - Type: String
    - Default: Cosine
    - Possible values;
      + Cosine
      + Euclidean
      + Hamming
      + DotProduct
    - Part of the VectorStore struct

*** storage
    - Type: StorageType
    - Default: UnsignedByte
    - Possible values
      + UnsignedByte
      + SubByte with u8 data
      + HalfPrecisionFP
    - Part of the VectorStore struct

*** offset
    - Meaning: address of the root vector in the index file
    - Type: version + offset (serialization of the ~EmbeddingOffset~
      struct; the same that's stored in the ~embeddings~ db in lmdb)

*** size
    - Meaning: Vector dimension
    - Type: usize
    - This will be specified as user input in the create collection
      API call

*** lower_bound
    - Type: f32
    - This will be specified as user input in the create collection

*** upper_bound
    - Type: f32
    - This will be specified as user input in the create collection

*** name
    - Name of the collection
    - Type: String

** Approaches for storing the data as values in lmdb

*** Option 1: Serialize in some format (bincode or an inefficient format like json)
    - Key = collection name
    - Value = json hashmap containing the above fields
**** Fetching list of collections at startup
     - The list of all collection names can be obtained by iterating
       through the keys. As this will be done only once at startup,
       this should be fine I guess.
**** Advantages:
     - Straightforward and easy to get started with
**** Disadvantages:
     - Overhead in serialization and deserialization (particularly if
       JSON is used)

*** Option 2: Multiple namespace qualified keys per collection in lmdb
    - Every field will be stored as a namespace qualified keys in a
      ~collections~ db. LMDB has transactions so all keys for a
      collection can be stored together atomically.
    - Examples:
      + <collname>:<field> => serialized data
      + mycoll:levels_prob
      + mycoll:quantization_metric
**** Fetching list of collections at startup
     - [ ] Need to check if it's possible to iterate through the keys
       by a prefix or some key range function
**** Advantages
     - Straightforward
     - Extensible: More keys can be easily added
     - Individual keys can be mutated easily
**** Disadvantages
     - Possibility of explosion of keys
     - [ ] Need to check how efficient is iteration over all keys using a
       prefix or a key function

** Questions
*** Data stored in embeddings, versions and branches lmdb tables
    - The data stored in these tables is not namespaced by
      collections. Would that be a problem?
    - Key collisions for data that belongs to different collections
      is possible
      + e.g. the key in embeddings db is VectorId which can be same
        for two vectors in different collections.
      + The key in branches db is also just branch id (u64).
*** Should current open transaction be persisted?
    - Scenario: when the db crashes while a transaction is running
    - This can be a future consideration
*** Create collection API call for existing collection?
    - What should be the behaviour if a client sends a create
      collection API request with a collection name that already
      exists?
